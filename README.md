# Solidity Joint Savings Smart Contract

A Solidity Joint Savings smart contract that features the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account. This contract accepts two user addresses that uses ether management functions to implement a financial institution's requirements for providing these functions. This repository contains:

+ Completed Solidity smart contract `joint_savings.sol`
+ `Execution_Results` folder with images of working smart contract. 


## Technologies
This project uses:
+ [Remix - Ethereum IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/): Used to build and test smart contracts created with Solidity.
+ [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.0/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html): Solidity is an object-oriented programming language for implementing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, most notably, Ethereum.


## Usage
Uses Solidity version 0.5.0. 

The Execution Results folder contains more images of running the different features of the smart contract.
